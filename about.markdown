## **About Me**
---
Welcome to my about page! Here's a glimpse into my coding journey and passion for technology.

### **Early Beginnings**
---
I began coding as a teenager in the late 1990s, starting with [Visual Basic 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)) to create simple point-and-click applications for personal projects and enjoyment. I soon transitioned to developing mods for video games like [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) using [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [UnrealScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine#UnrealScript). Around the same time, I started building websites using free hosting platforms like [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) and [Angelfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire), which sparked my interest in web development.

### **Growth and Exploration**
---
As my skills grew, I began designing and hosting websites for gaming clans, gaining experience with platforms like [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) and [vBulletin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin). I developed custom themes, styles, and plugins for these platforms, exploring the creative and technical possibilities they offered. I also worked with [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) to create animations and applications in [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), before [Adobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.) eventually acquired and discontinued it. Additionally, I enjoyed making custom [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) themes, honing my skills with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

### **Current Focus**
---
Today, my focus is primarily on web development, working with [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL). Recently, I’ve been incorporating [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)) into my projects more consistently, further expanding my expertise. Beyond web development, I occasionally use [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) to create scripts for personal use, such as organizing my movie library.

### **Looking Ahead**
---
For the past two decades, web development has been a passion I pursued alongside my career in the [United States Air Force](https://www.airforce.com/). Throughout that time, I remained committed to learning new technologies, programming languages, and best practices as the industry evolved. Now, as I look forward to transitioning back to civilian life, I’m excited to turn my long-standing passion for coding into a full-time career.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about my journey!
