This project replaces a paper form with a web-based version, enabling users to enter information that PHP processes and stores as a delimited file. It also generates a web invoice with calculated pricing, simplifying data entry and enhancing user experience with a professional invoice display. The site is built with PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.<!-- excerpt-end -->
