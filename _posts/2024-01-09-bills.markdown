## Bill Tracker
<!-- excerpt-start -->
For years, I managed my bills with a complex spreadsheet. I tried various bill tracking apps, but most focused on syncing with my bank, which wasnâ€™t what I wanted. I needed a simple way to input and track my bills, so I built my own app using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Now I have a straightforward solution that meets my needs without unnecessary complications.<!-- excerpt-end -->
