## 1206
<!-- excerpt-start -->
When working on a 1206, you often spend significant time managing PDF documents for multiple individuals. You frequently email various versions for review, leading to confusion and inefficiency. This solution provides a single source for managing awards, allowing users to save progress and easily resume from anywhere. Developed using PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.<!-- excerpt-end -->
