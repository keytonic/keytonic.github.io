## My Journey to Starting a Blog
---

I've wanted to create a blog for a long time, but I never felt like I had anything to write about. Lately, I've been working on more projects to showcase and strengthen my web development [portfolio](https://andrewtowner.com). Recently, I came across a cool static site generator written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and I wanted to get familiar with it. I also want to start hosting more projects on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). With all these goals in progress or on the horizon, I thought why not create a blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [host it on GitHub](https://github.com/keytonic/keytonic.github.io), and use it to document my future projects as I complete them? And that, my friends, is exactly what we have here.

## Why Jekyll and GitHub Pages?
---

It turns out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is perfect for this because [GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), and your site is automatically generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) when you push your source files. This makes it incredibly easy to manage a static website without dealing with complex deployment processes.

## Customizing My Blog Theme
---

When you generate your first static webpage with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it comes with a default theme called [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I decided to stick with this theme because I love how easily you can create new blog posts just by adding Markdown files. However, I heavily modified it and made significant changes to its functionality to better fit my needs.

## Designing My Personal Logo
---

I spent a lot of time trying to design a logo I truly liked. I wanted something simple and flat that reflected my personality, but I’ve struggled with this in the past as well. If you check my [portfolio website](https://andrewtowner.com), you’ll see that this wasn’t my first attempt at creating a logo for my personal brand.

## Summary
---

<!-- excerpt-start -->Building this blog has been a great learning experience. Not only have I explored [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I’ve also taken the opportunity to refine my personal branding and web development skills. Moving forward, I plan to use this space to share my projects, insights, and the lessons I learn along the way. Stay tuned for more updates!<!-- excerpt-end -->
