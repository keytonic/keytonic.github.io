## Tom’s Nuisance Critter Control
---
<!-- excerpt-start -->I had the opportunity to develop the website and custom theme for [https://trappertom.com](https://trappertom.com), utilizing a combination of [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). This project required a strong focus on design and functionality to create a seamless experience for visitors seeking professional critter control services.<!-- excerpt-end -->

### Tech Stack Breakdown
---
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) powers the backend, handling dynamic content and server-side logic.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) enhances interactivity, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) **&** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) work together to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) serves as the platform, enabling easy content management and customization.

By leveraging these technologies and strategies, I crafted a site that not only looks great but also functions efficiently for both users and administrators. My goal was to deliver a website that reflects Tom’s expertise in critter control while making it easy for potential customers to access essential information.
