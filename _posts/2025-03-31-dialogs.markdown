## React-Dialogs
---
<!-- excerpt-start -->This is a React component I created to provide custom, draggable, and fully resizable dialogs. My goal was to develop a robust and easily customizable dialog component that I could quickly integrate into any future project. I drew inspiration from native Windows popups and JavaScript dialogs. The component includes three types of dialogs: Alert, Confirm, and Prompt. [See it in action here!](https://keytonic.github.io/React-Dialogs)<!-- excerpt-end -->

Please check out my post at [GitHub](https://github.com/keytonic/React-Dialogs) for examples annd details.
