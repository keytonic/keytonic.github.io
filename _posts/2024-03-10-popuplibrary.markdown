## Popup Library
<!-- excerpt-start -->
I've always wanted to create a library for easily building clean, draggable popups and alerts. This project aims to provide a simple toolkit that I can integrate into future projects as needed. Developed with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, it focuses on enhancing user interaction and making implementation straightforward.<!-- excerpt-end -->
