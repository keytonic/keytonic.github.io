## droodo
<!-- excerpt-start -->
A task manager designed like a ‘to-do list’. The name is a clever play on words, combining my name ‘Drew’ with ‘to-do’ to create ‘DrooDo’. I heavily utilized an app in the past called ‘Wunderlist’, however, Microsoft acquired it and discontinued it. The idea was to create a similar application, developed using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
